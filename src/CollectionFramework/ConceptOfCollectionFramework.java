		 Collection in java is a framework which is used 
		 to store and manipulate the group of objects.
		 
		 Operation that we can perform using this framework are 
		 Searching, Insertion , Manipulation , Deletion , sorting
		 
		 In collection different Interface are available 
		 and they are ,
		 
		 Set , list, Queue and Dequeue
		 
		 Some important Class are 
		 ArrayList
		 Vector
		 LinkedList
		 Hash set
		 Tree set
		 Priority Queue
		 
		  
		  This entire collection framework is available in JDK
		  under one package and the package s called Java.util package 
		  
		**Collection is a interface in java
		
		How the framework work
		
		Interface Collection implements Itable (Interface or super super interface)
		Now Three more interface and they are List , Set , Queue
		Now list
		
		Collection is super class of List
		
		for list interface the class are 
		
		ArrayList implements List
		LinkList implements List
		Vector implements List
		
		Now there is on more class and that is Stack
		but is the child class of Vector class so,
		
		Stack extends Vector
		
		 
		
		
		Now Set 
		
	    Collection is super class of Set
	    
	    HashSet implements Set
	    LinkedHashSet implements Set
		
	
		
		Now Queue
		
		Collection is super class of Queue
		PriorityQueue extends Queue 
		
		We have two more interface and they are 
		
		Dequeue and SortedSet
		
		ArrayDeque implements Dequeue
		LinkedList implements Dequeue
		
		Queue is the super interface of Dequeue
		
		TreeSet implements SortedSet
		
		SortedSet is the child interface of Set
		
		
		We describe the relation between two interface by
		Child Interface extends Parent Interface 
		
		
		
		
		We describe relation between interface and class by
		Class implements Interface 
		For multiple interface we have 
		Class implements Interface,Interface
